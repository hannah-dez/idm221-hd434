        <p class="paragraph">In my Interaction Design class, I was tasked to spend ten weeks redesigning and animating micro-interactions in an existing app. Using Figma and Adobe After Affects I was redesigned an app called Flora. This is a study timer app that also doubles as a donation platform to plant trees. As you study a tree will grow on the app, if you cancel the study timer or go on your phone while the timer is running your tree will die. I used this app pretty frequently to keep myself focused and wanted to see where I could make improvements. My main goal was to add more fun and personality to the micro-interactions and animations.</p>
        <h2>Critique</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">This app was extremely well designed. I enjoyed the color scheme and simple graphics. However, there were some jarring interruptions throughout the app. The keyboard and pop ups all were attuned to the classic apple popups, which were stark white, black and blue. This made the app less cohesive and interrupted the calm nature of the apps design.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I wanted to find a way to design pop-ups and keyboards to fit more cohesively into the design. I also wanted to add new interactions that would enhance the experience. For example, during your study time you are allowed to set a break-time and can start that break whenever you want. When this happens in the original app all that happens is the timer stops counting, and a break timer starts. Then a light gray overlay falls over most of the page. I felt this was good and subtle, but if the person was taking a break a small animation wouldn't be too distracting and could add personality to the feature.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I also wanted to add a subtle animation that would be a physical representation of the users progress. In the original app there is just a steady background screen of a sprout. It doesn't change until the end of the study timer and then a page pops up stating what type of plant you grew. When using the app, that sometimes was discouraging because all I would focus on is how much time I had left to keep studying. I wanted a way to make it encouraging when a person glanced at their timer.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Overall, I wanted to add my own form of organization and a new user flow to the app.</p>

            <h2>Process and Improvements</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">I started by redesigning the color scheme, typography, and creating a user persona and UX flow. Then I looked to the details and focused on designing all of the popups and keyboard to fit my new design of the app. This created a much more cohesive experience that wouldn't pull the user our of their focus.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Next, I focused on new animations that wouldn't draw focus away but could enhance the user experience. With my design, when the user pauses their timer clouds would roll in over the sun and pause the timer. This was a subtle animation that added a bit of storytelling, because, as we all know, plants can't grow without sunlight. I also changed the format of the background of the timer to be dynamic and subtly changing over the study period. I added the sun so that it would gradually set until you finished studying. That way during studying, if someone were to look at the timer, they would see a change and know they had made progress.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I animated the tree growing as time went on in a study session. This was so that the studier would be encouraged to keep going to see their fully grown tree. Instead of only seeing how much time they have left to keep studying, the user can look at how much progress they have made shown in the growth of   the tree.</p>

                <p class= "caption">Before</p> <p class="caption">After</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="imgseperator"></div>
            <p class="paragraph">With my redesign, I did an overall reorganization of the app in order to encourage the studier and create a more fun environment. I added a garden and a graveyard. Originally there was just a list of the trees that you had grown and the ones that had died intermixed. I separated them into two pages, each would have a scrollable section that showed all of the trees the user had grown/killed, then under there would be a list with the study stats of that growth period.</p>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">This project helped me fall into a workflow that really worked for me as a designer. I enjoyed working in a mobile field and seeing the big effects small interactions could have. Using physical paper to sketch out any and all ideas was an exciting process that helped me think about the details of the site. I am very proud of my final product. I spent a massive amount of time animating the timer and the keyboard. There was a filter I could have used, but it didn't match my aesthetic goals. After affects took a second to learn, but once I understood the basics I really enjoyed working with the program. I love what I was able to produce and am proud of the outcome of my brunt work.</p>
