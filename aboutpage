# About
## Personal
    Hi, I’m Hannah Desmond! I am originally from Los Angeles, California but am now located in Philadelphia.

    Growing up I was immersed in creativity. My dad was always writing screenplays and my mom had the voice of an angel. They always encouraged me to explore my areas of interest, and I found that my interest always circled back to things related to the arts. I have developed a love of exploring different ways I can apply my creativity. I play guitar, paint, draw, sing, design, write, read, and dance. With every new form of expression, I find more and more enjoyment in life. My favorite part of the creative process is learning the fundamentals of something and then exploring the limits of what I can do with it.

    I am a very social person and love meeting new people. Around campus or in classes, I love being surrounded by friendly faces. When I moved out to Philadelphia, I wanted to find a smaller community within Drexel University, so I decided to join the Delta Gamma sorority on campus. Through my joining I have made lifelong friends and a wonderful home away from home. I love going out, studying, and exploring Philadelphia with my sisters!
## Professional
    I am currently a student at Drexel University. I’m studying User Experience and Interaction Design with a tight knit group of people. I enjoy being a part of a smaller major that I can connect with and get feedback from.

    Throughout my life I have found myself in several areas of leadership. Currently I am on the recruitment team of my sorority. I help run events, fundraise, and promote my sisterhood across campus. Working on a team, we train our sisters on recruiting new members and educating the chapter on our histories and values. I’ve gained a lot of experience in communication and forward thinking in this position. Also, due to my major, I have been able to put into practice my enjoyment and knowledge of design through the creation of different graphics, posters, and activity sheets. Prior to college I was on my High Schools improv team. I was the team manager, organizing games with other schools, special events, training new team members, and coaching my friends on performance. Due to this experience, I am comfortable in front of people presenting ideas and helpful criticisms.
    
    Over the summer of 2023 I got my first job in a professional setting. I was a camp counselor at Steve and Kate’s camp Pasadena. There I worked with kids from the ages of 4 to 14. I was a support counselor and would walk through the different areas, staying where I was needed most. This allowed me to practice and build up my adaptability and quick thinking as the problems I had to deal with varied drastically based on the age group I was talking to. It was a wonderful experience and I loved working with the kids there.
 
    In the future, I hope to apply the skills I will learn here at Drexel to a position that works in one of my several areas of interest. I want to find a cause I care deeply about and be able to aid its foundations with my skills.
