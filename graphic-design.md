## Figma and Website Redesigns
### Generic Website Redesign
I was tasked with redesigning a generic website based on a theme. The first theme was hyper-punk and the second was constructivism. Here are my two redesigns, which I allowed myself to run wild with.
### Origional Redesign for Ultimate Guitar
This project was to redesign the home page of a website in mobile, tablet, and desktop form. The next quarter we would build out the desktop version with more pages. This is my first draft which allowed me to explore creatively and work out the kinks of the project.

## Visual Studies Section One: Black, White, and Greyscale
In this class we focused on becoming familiar with different adobe products. I learned about the basics of composition and design along with physical art techniques.

## Visual Studies Section Two: Color
Next, I focused on color and color interaction. In this section we learned about color theory, space, movement, and design.
